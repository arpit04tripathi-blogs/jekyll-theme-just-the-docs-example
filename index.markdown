This is an example of theme [just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs){:target="_blank"}

- It is NOT one of the built-in [supported themes](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#supported-themes){:target="_blank"} for GitHub Pages
- So we can:
  - install it using `Gemfile`
  - OR use `jekyll-remote-theme` Jekyll plugin
